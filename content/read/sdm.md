## Reading

- SDMs **[SDM intro](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/011-species-distribution-models.html)**

- Model performance **[Norberg et al. 2020](https://taddallas.github.io/papers/Norberg2019.pdf)**

Pay close attention to how the model performance was assessed in terms of accuracy, discrimination, calibration, and precision.
