data/lessons.yml is how the syllabus is populated and links to things in the content folder.


blogdown::serve_site() to locally serve the site in R

assignments are templates in separate repos of a GitHub org site (similar to the reproducible research course)







## Modules

+ Intro to R
  - outcomes: R, R markdown, GitHub, 
  - just introduce basic computing concepts in this module. Maybe use real data?


+ Host-virus associations (VIRION) 
  - outcomes: R, visualization, subsetting, some dplyr/group_by/pipe shit, writing functions, 
  - use helmVirus as a use case to teach from?
  - Travis-CI/GitHub actions could be introduced here 
  - Working with dynamic data could come in here too by pulling data from URL (use covid as an example dataset?)



+ Species distribution modeling
  - outcomes: API, data manipulation, spatial data, modeling basics, forecasting
  - Use GBIF to visualize spatial data and discuss the concept of regression to forecast species distributions? 


+ Simulating biological dynamics
  - outcome: function writing, iteration, parallel programming, 
  - have them code up the logistic model and push it around? 
  - then do SIR. Have them calculate different epidemic properties.
  - maybe other population growth rate models? The importance is on the simulation.








### potential modules (much of this worked into existing modules)

+ Communicating your science
  - outcomes: Travis-CI, dependency hell, Reproducibility, R markdown
  - focused on visualization and report writing, but from the standpoint of reproducibility
